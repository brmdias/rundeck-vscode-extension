# Rundeck VSCode Extension

Integrate Rundeck job management directly into VS Code. This extension lets you connect to a Rundeck cluster, test the connection, and upload job definitions with a streamlined workflow.

## Features

- Connect to a Rundeck cluster and persist credentials securely
- Test Rundeck API connection health
- Edit embedded job scripts directly in temporary files with live sync back to YAML
- Upload job YAML files to a Rundeck project (removes `uuid` and `id` fields automatically)
- Automatically patches YAML with any saved script edits before upload
- Remembers project name for future uploads
- Uses VS Code UI for all prompts and file selection

## Installation

### Option A: Install Prebuilt VSIX (Recommended)

1. Download `rundeck-vscode-extension-1.1.0.vsix` from the releases page - [link here](https://github.com/brmdias/rundeck-vscode-extension/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
2. In VS Code run the command: `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` and select the file, or use the CLI:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension rundeck-vscode-extension-1.1.0.vsix
   ```
3. Reload VS Code if prompted.

### Option B: Build From Source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `npm install` in the project folder
3. Build with `npm run compile` (or `npm run watch` during development)
4. Press F5 in VS Code to launch a new Extension Development Host
5. (Optional) Package a VSIX with: `vsce package` which produces the `.vsix` file you can distribute.

### Requirements

- VS Code 1.88+ (tested)
- Node.js 18+ for building from source
- A Rundeck API token with permissions to read system info and import jobs


## Usage

### 1. Connect to Rundeck Cluster
Run the command `Connect to Rundeck Cluster` from the command palette. Enter your Rundeck API token, server URL, and optionally a project name. Credentials are stored securely for future use.

### 2. Test Connection
Run `Test Rundeck Connection` to verify your saved API token and cluster health.

### 3. Edit Job Script(s)
Run `Edit Job Script` while a job YAML is active (or select one). The extension parses `sequence.commands` and:

- If only one `script` command exists, it opens it directly in a temp file (`.sh` or `.py` based on `scriptInterpreter`).
- If multiple script commands exist, a Quick Pick appears listing each by its description (or `Script #<index>` when no description). Select one to edit.

When you save the temporary script file, the associated job YAML file is immediately updated in-place with the latest script content. You can open and edit multiple script commands (each gets its own temp file) before uploading.

### 4. Upload Rundeck Job
Run `Upload Rundeck Job`. If a project name is not set, you will be prompted for it. The extension:

1. Loads the selected job YAML (active editor preferred, otherwise file picker)
2. Applies all pending script edits from open temp script files for that job
3. Removes `uuid` and `id` fields
4. Wraps the job definition in an array if needed (Rundeck expects a list)
5. Imports with `uuidOption=remove` and `dupeOption=update`

## Developer Workflow

- **Build:** `npm run compile`
- **Watch:** `npm run watch`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Test:** `npm test`
- **Debug:** Use the "Run Extension" launch configuration

## Project Structure

- `src/extension.ts`: Main extension logic and command registration
- `package.json`: Extension manifest and command contributions
- `test/extension.test.ts`: Example test file (expand for more coverage)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: AI agent instructions

## Configuration

No custom settings required. All connection parameters (API token, server URL, project name) are managed via VS Code's global state.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Minimal test coverage (expand `test/extension.test.ts` for more reliability)
- Temp script files are not auto-cleaned; they remain in your system temp directory
 - Temp script files are not auto-cleaned; they remain in your system temp directory (e.g. `os.tmpdir()`); you may delete them manually if desired
- Only the first job in a multi-job YAML file is currently considered for script editing
- Advanced Rundeck import options (e.g., partial diffs, ACLs) are not exposed yet
- Deprecated helper `extractScriptAndType` retained for compatibility; new development should use multi-script flow
